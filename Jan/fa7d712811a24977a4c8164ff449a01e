Visit the Bottelary Hills Renosterveld Conservancy (BHRC), just outside Stellenbosch and enjoy a variety of activities that cater for families, nature lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, mountain bikers, food and wine connoisseurs. Explore a 92km trail network through rolling hillsides, conservation areas, vineyards and farmland in the Bottelary Hills. The multiple route options cater for various skill and fitness levels. The BHRC is a registered non-profit organisation that forms part of the Cape Winelands Biosphere Reserve. Although the core focus of the BHRC is to care for, expand and sustain the large tracts of remaining Renosterveld in the area, there is a strong emphasis on community development. Concerned landowners together with Cape Nature Conservation initiated a conservation program to protect the remaining vegetation, rehabilitate sensitive areas and reintroduce species lost to the area. The Bottelary Hills Renosterveld Conservancy was founded in 1992 and encloses the Bottelary Hills situated on the northern fringe of Stellenbosch. The tranquil surroundings provide the perfect backdrop for a wellness weekend or a relaxing game of golf at one of the world class golf courses around Stellenbosch. The ever-evolving network of MTB trails remains a key attraction. Although the MTB trails are single-use, many of the member farms have hiking trails on their properties. The Bottelary Hills Renosterveld Conservancy serves as an example of a successful landowner-driven conservation area. “We are grateful to our member farms that commit to implementing environmentally sustainable farming practices, fire management and alien eradication, with the conservation and protection of the Renosterveld a major priority.”
