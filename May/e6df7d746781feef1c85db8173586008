Kipling, a well-recognised and desirable fashion bag brand, sold in-store at Frasers, has partnered with Coca-Cola to produce an iconic range of bags in their Live Light Responsibly campaign. The Kipling | Coca-Cola collab uses material from PET bottles, 272,129 of them now saved from landfill, woven into durable ripstop material in Coca-Cola’s famous red and white. “Kipling knows that we are responsible for the impact our products have on the planet and are committed to live. Light by constantly reimagining designs, rethinking material, repurposing energy, and reconnecting to people and the planet. This collaboration for the Kipling SS21 collection, is a refreshed and hip take on the brand’s efforts to be more responsible.” Some of Kipling’s best-selling models have been revamped for this trendy partnership, like the Art Medium bag – a Kipling darling. All the new designs in the collab have fantastically fun zipper pulls inspired by aluminium can pull tabs. For the collab, Kipling’s versatile Art Mini has a more subtle 3D embossed detail, reminiscent of the bubbly effervescence of the world’s favourite drink, with the Coca-Cola logo peering through. This over-the-shoulder is perfect for an evening on-the-go.
