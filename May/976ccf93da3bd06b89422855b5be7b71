Autumn may be a time of rest in the vineyards of the Western Cape winelands, but Bosjes Estate situated in the scenic Breede River valley, is brimming with new energy as it reveals the next phase in its evolution, with a new high design pantry style coffee shop and farm shop set amid imaginatively landscaped indigenous gardens. Bosjes has grown in stature and acclaim since opening in March 2017. Creating imaginative outdoor spaces was key to the design of the new gardens. Within the new garden guests can enjoy two new visitor offerings on the estate, the Bosjes Spens and Winkel. The Winkel is Bosjes’ contemporary interpretation of a country store with a covetable collection of bespoke wares, local crafts and upcycled décor – curation of old and new, artisanal and unique. A short walk through the gardens brings visitors to the Spens, which blends the best elements of a café, coffee shop and well-stocked country pantry. On the shelves discover seasonal preserves using fruit from the valley. The landscaped gardens are spread across three sloping terraces, connected by a curving pathway that provides universal access while creating a visual link between the woodland landscape, forested play areas, spacious lawns and conservation garden planted with endangered renosterveld. Across the site there are visual cues that remind visitors of the cultural heritage of the valley – a series of water furrows and channels, fragrant citrus groves in front of the Winkel and Spens, Circular sandpits for children, while in the dedicated children’s play area equipment includes kid-friendly farming implements, sandpits and splash-pads. An Insta-friendly highlight of the garden is the Boombrug, a treetop-walkway that meanders amongst the hundreds of trees planted to create the remarkable indigenous woodland. Alongside zip-lines and entertaining clamber-frames for kids, the Boombrug offers panoramic views of the Breede River valley. *Check opening times before visiting
