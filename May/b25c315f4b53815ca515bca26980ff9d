A group of keen mountain bikers will depart on 27 June 2021 for the annual 6-day CA2CX MTB Tour, now in its 16th year. The riders will start at Klein Joostenberg, near Stellenbosch to conquer a distance of 695km to Knysna. The daily route of about 100km per stage consists of farmlands, spectacular landscapes and amazing views. Back-up vehicles will secure your safety and you will be treated in 3 – 5 star accommodation establishments. Participants can enter in one of the following groups: 22 kmph and up, 18 kmph – 22 kmph, 14 – 18 kmph or e-Bike group. The 6-day CA2CX MTB event will take riders from Klein Joostenberg via Worcester, Montagu, through the Klein Karoo towns of Ladismith, Van Wyksdorp, over the Rooiberg Pass near Calitzdorp to Oudtshoorn, down the Montagu Pass to George, and then travelling over 8 passes to finish in Knysna. Every year CA2CX Tour returns favour by giving back to the community. A gala evening will be held in George on the eve of the last stage with the traditional auction to raise funds for the Herberg Children home in Robertson, as beneficiary for the CA2CX MTB Tour.
Last year with the help of the CA2CX riders and sponsors an amount of R414 000 was raised. For more information contact Johan Steyn on 082 938 9886 or visit www.mountainbikeadventuretours.co.za
