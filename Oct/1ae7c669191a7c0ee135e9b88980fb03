It will undoubtedly be a truly unique Absa Cape Epic experience in October (36 months since the 2019 Absa Cape Epic concluded). It is all systems go for event staff and the 300 teams who are racing the 2021 Absa Cape Epic. The organisers of The Race That Measures All, have remained committed to doing everything possible to ensure the 2021 Absa Cape Epic takes place safely and successfully from 17-24 October and that riders, both local and international, are offered the very best mountain bike experience. Several necessary changes will be introduced to ensure compliance with government regulations and best practices, including the additional guidelines outlined by CyclingSA and the Department of Sport, Arts, and Culture for the safe return of sanctioned mass participation in cycling events. Most notably, the event will not have spectators, and access to race villages, water points, and other official areas will be strictly controlled. All participants and event staff must present a negative Covid-19 test before the start of the race and submit to a further antigen test during the event as an added screening measure. Whilst not a prerequisite to participate in the Absa Cape Epic, we do encourage all participants to be vaccinated. Further Covid-19 mitigation plans are in place and will be enforced. Fans and supporters of the race can expect a full daily Live Broadcast that will be available on the Absa Cape Epic Facebook page and YouTube channel, as well as on SuperSport. In addition to the Live Broadcast, there will be daily highlight shows and blow-by-blow action on social media throughout the eight days of the event.
