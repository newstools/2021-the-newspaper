Women have always led the demand for tasty healthier options when it comes to beverages and whilst some alternatives have successfully come to market, more have vanished before you could blink. But leave it to one of the most admired beverage producers in the world, Sanpellegrino, to give us a sophisticated taste of the Italian way of life that you can enjoy guilt-free. S.Pellegrino Essenza is characterised by vibrant blends of Mediterranean fruit flavours, enhanced by the crafted refined bubbles of sparkling mineral water. The process contains no sweeteners and all flavours are natural. Each can of S.Pellegrino Essenza has zero calories – delicious and refreshing, perfect to quench your thirst, or simply sip along with a divine canape, and without feeling guilty! Three of the five flavours are available in South Africa – and whilst the aromas are all intense, each flavour pairing perfectly harmonises to deliver that delicious burst when it hits your palette. Flavours available are Lemon & Lemon Zest, Tangerine & Wild Strawberry and lastly Dark Morello Cherry & Pomegranate.
