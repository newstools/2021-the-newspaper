Not only does the new season bring with it the promise of warmer weather, but it’s also time to make your way to the Franschhoek Wine Valley for this year’s Franschhoek Uncorked Festival (16 & 17 October). What better excuse to explore one of South Africa’s premier wine destinations, whilst uncovering a fine selection of wine gems from the Franschhoek Vignerons. This year no less than 12 wineries have already confirmed their participation, with more to follow. Participating wineries in and around the valley will use the opportunity to showcase this season’s new release wines, which include MCC’s, white wines, rosés, and even a few Summer inspired red varietals. Live music and great food add extra excitement to a fun day out. Be on the lookout for a few special events guaranteed to pique your interest.
Pack the car and set off for the Winelands with its fresh country air and exquisite views whilst travelling from farm to farm. With most of the Franschhoek wineries participating in this fun weekend festival, there promises to be something for everyone. For more information visit www.franschhoekuncorked.co.za
