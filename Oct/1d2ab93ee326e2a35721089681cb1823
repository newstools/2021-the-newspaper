The first biophilic development in Africa has been launched in Cape Town and will see a 24-story living, breathing mixed-use building take residence on Upper Bree Street in the heart of the city CBD. This first-of-its-kind building, situated at 142 Bree Street, will feature 689 apartments and includes a rooftop sunset terrace with lap pool and co-working space, a rooftop fitness centre, as well as a ground-floor plant-based restaurant, a tearoom, and a botanical bar. “As the first truly biophilic living structure on the continent, The Fynbos – which is currently in the process of achieving Green Star certification from the Green Building Council – will have several innate sustainability features built into it from inception,” says Paul Upton, head of developments for Dogon Group Properties, marketing agents for The Fynbos, who explains that the biophilic concept centres on integrating nature into an urban setting. According to Upton, climate control at The Fynbos, which was designed by architects TwentyEightZeroTwo, will be provided by natural layers, with exterior plantings having a cooling effect to provide shade and screening. One of the most exceptional sustainable design features at The Fynbos is its exterior, which is draped in a 1200m2 vertical garden made up of 30 species of indigenous trees and 20 species of shrub. The pioneering garden system at The Fynbos was meticulously designed and executed by a specialist team of technical botanists headed up by Donovan Gillman of Urban Choreography. 100% indigenous to the Cape, each plant at The Fynbos is considered for aesthetics and resilience. The look is green, leafy, and geometric. Apartments within this exceptional development, spearheaded by Lurra Capital and supported locally by Gardner Property Solutions, are scaled and priced to appeal to a diverse audience.
