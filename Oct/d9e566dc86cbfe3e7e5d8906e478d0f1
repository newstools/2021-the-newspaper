LittleHill Montessori opened its doors in Johannesburg in 2005 with the vision of providing children with a safe and comfortable space where they could grow and learn. “Now we will be coming to a secure Balwin estate near you!” “Our school emphasises independence, creativity, problem-solving, and concentration beginning at an early age. Our Montessori qualified teachers’ goal is to cultivate a lifelong learner through a thoughtfully prepared environment where children are encouraged to select work and assume responsibilities through their natural desire to learn.” The schools are purpose-built and kitted out with the full range of Montessori equipment. Large, airy classrooms have been designed to cater to every little one’s developmental needs, while spacious playgrounds offer a jungle gym, sandpit, and bike track as well as learning spaces for gardening, planting & botany. Safety and security are of paramount importance, and the school and classrooms have been fitted with CCTV cameras. LittleHill is a member of the South African Montessori Association (SAMA) & the SA Childcare Association. FEE STRUCTURE 2021 & 2022
