The La Colombe Group, which currently has five restaurants in its fold, will add two new ones in December when it opens PIER Restaurant and The Waterside Restaurant at the V&A Waterfront. The new eateries will be located in the Pierhead Building, in between the NSRI building and Life Grand Café. PIER Restaurant will bring an intimate, multi-course fine-dining experience that will be led by chef John Norris-Rogers, previously of La Petite Colombe in Franschhoek, while Roxy Mudie will be at the helm of The Waterside Restaurant. Previously, Roxy was sous chef at both La Colombe and Protégé. Roxy has worked with Scot Kirton at La Colombe for seven years. She is a bubble of talent waiting to explode in this exciting new space. Guests dining at PIER can expect local produce to be the focus, with a special emphasis on inspiration from the ocean – and the tableside theatrics guests have come to expect from the team. Dishes that diners can look forward to including confit mussels slowly cooked in chorizo oil or oysters poached tableside by the chefs. The Waterside Restaurant will serve a sophisticated but more casual menu that guests can enjoy both indoors and on the outdoor deck – perfect for sumptuous summer lunches. Two different menus will be available upon its launch – a four-course menu with a selection of choices or a more formal eight-course tasting menu.
