Rainbow Sidewalk Chalk is an eco-friendly business in Cape Town, manufacturing non-toxic chalk. The company owned by Liesel Gaffley aims to help children refine their fine motor skills and inspire and educate them. Liesel started the business from home in January 2021 to support her family. “I have 2 boys on the autism spectrum and for them holding a crayon or pen is quite difficult as they have low muscle tone. My youngest son Adam loves chalk, and the chalk I bought at the store kept on breaking and I had to buy it regularly. I tried making lego chalk to help with this, and it snowballed from there. I love making chalk and I love seeing the kid’s faces when they use the chalk. Furthermore, I am so grateful to have a small business and hopefully, one day to grow so that I can employ more ladies that can then help support their families. I felt that there were also not many chalk colors and designs available in South Africa. Our chalk is perfect for fine motor skills and with much-needed time for the kids to be outdoors and be creative.” Rainbow Sidewalk Chalk make their chalk in small, unique batches in fun and colorful designs – perfectly designed to fit in small hands. Rainbow Sidewalk Chalk offers Dinosaurs, Chalksicles, Macaroons, Gemstone, Personalized Name Sets, Alphabet A-Z, Numbers, Lego, Unicorn horns, various Christmas sets and many more to choose from.
