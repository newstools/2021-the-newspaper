The German word, “bummeln,” gives meaning to that of taking a leisurely stroll. “As the Owner of Bummel Shoes, we strive to provide utter comfort when someone wears our shoes,” says Michael Stumpfe. The greatest secret in owning good footwear is the quality of the product. It is both the quality and craftmanship in manufacturing the footwear which results in providing the best in shoes – Bummels’ Leather shoes. Bummel Leather shoes are most definitely the best engineered product. It’s breathable. It doesn’t smell. Furthermore, it’s comfortable, and above all it is a genuinely well-presented product, high in quality.  Hidden Sectrets to consider when purchasing Leather Shoes – Does the shoe you intend purchasing have a veg leather tanned insole?
– If not, then 80% of the foot sweat need to find some other place to release its sweat.
– The question may be raised as to what makes the Bummel Leather shoe so special? We find the answer in their design and manufacturing process. Bummel meticulously fit their shoes with a veg tan leather insole to contain the foot sweat. The next step in creating only the best in Leather shoes is that Bummel only uses the finest upper leather, which moulds itself according to the shape of the foot within the shoe. Between the foot and the upper leather, Bummel then adds a leather lining to cover the stiffener in the heal as well as at the toe of the shoe which gives support to the shoe and thereby prevent the foot of sticking to a synthetic material. This is the reason why Bummel Leather Shoes is the better, if not the best in its field. Bummel manufactures leather shoes made of leather upper, leather lining, and veg leather tanned insole where no synthetic touches the foot. Bummel is the shoe that speaks to the foot, it is a breathable shoe, and allows the foot to happily feel the difference – what a joy for the foot to live in such comfort.  It is all leather – Handmade by highly skilled, and well-trained artisans. If you are unable to visit the Bummel Shoe store in George, you can view Michael’s accomplishments on the Bummel website.
