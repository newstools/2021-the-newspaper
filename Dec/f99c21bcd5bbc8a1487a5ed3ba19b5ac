Summer is the season for juicy, ripe plums – a good time to get creative in the kitchen in concert with Roodeberg’s Classic Red Blend. A Veritas gold medallist, the 2020 vintage of this multi-varietal Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend is a symphony of textures and tastes that meld beautifully with luscious stewed or baked plums. Aromatic layers of fresh fruit with hints of spice and dark chocolate lead your senses to a mouthful of plums and cedar oak wrapped in silky tannins that linger long after the last sip. Besides being a sumptuous taste partner with Roodeberg, plums pack a nutritious punch. Rich in antioxidants, potassium and fibre, they are naturally sweet yet low in calories with a low glycaemic index (GI). Roodeberg inspires a lifetime of stories in every bottle. Be part of this impressive legacy spanning over 70 years by creating your own Roodeberg story with foodie Elmarie Berry’s delicious Plum and Black Pepper Pie recipe. Your friends and family will love this fruity summer pie served with a glass or two Roodeberg, of course! For more Roodeberg stories and recipes visit www.roodeberg.co.za
