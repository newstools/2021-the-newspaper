The Cape Town Motorcycle Club (CTMCC) was delighted to hear that the national government eased Covid-19 restrictions and place them in a position to host their annual rally – a rally which usually attracts about 120 – 150 participants. This was the 41st consecutive club rally, which has always been held for members, invited guests and families who enjoy the camaraderie of motorcycling without the rowdiness that sometimes accompanies such events. This year, the CTMCC decided once again to assist four charities in Swellendam with good quality, previously loved clothing and other essential items donated by club members and their families. Each charitable cause has some bearing and is close to the hearts of the members of the CTMCC. The Langeberg Hospice Shop, the SPCA, Huis Adaliah and Huis AA Tomlinson were once again the recipients of vast amounts of donated goods. “The reason why Swellendam was chosen for the annual rally once again is the fantastic support provided by members of the local business fraternity and the local municipality.”
“Since our first event in 2016 we have been overwhelmed by their support and appreciation of our efforts. Special mention has to be extended to Gerry Fourie of Barrel and Blues, Reinette Aubrey of Langeberg Hospice and Keith Stuurman of the local municipality.” “Without their assistance and co-operation, this event would not be possible. We certainly had a good time and will be back in Swellendam next year,” says Bobby McGee, Chairman of Cape Town Motorcycle Club. The CTMCC has been existing since 1979 with a membership of 121 riders (2 of whom are still active founder members) and mainly consists of the older, more responsible type of motorcyclist.
