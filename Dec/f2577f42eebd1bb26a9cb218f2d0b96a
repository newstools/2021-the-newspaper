The College of Magic’s always popular Children’s Magic Festival makes a wild return to the Mother City from 14 – 18 December 2021, with a thrilling new theme: Safari! Five days of spellbinding entertainment with a touch of adventure awaits Festival goers at the College of Magic’s mysterious Victorian manor in Claremont. Young explorers and their families are invited to dress up to the theme – the Big 5 of the animal kingdom, courageous trackers, thrill-seeking adventurers and more! The Children’s Magic Festival, one of the College of Magic’s major fundraising events each year, has been entertaining Capetonian families each winter school holiday since 1994. The College of Magic will present the 2021 Children’s Magic Festival in partnership with the City of Cape Town. Following a two-year break due to the national lockdown and with the December holiday bringing sunshine to the magical hijinks, the College of Magic has conjured an all-new format for this wildly popular event, including: An outdoor magic show, social distancing seating format in our outdoor eco-theatre, A self-guided tour through the College’s century-old mansion, Opportunities for Festival goers to observe jugglers, clowns, puppeteers and more in their natural enchanting habitat, No safari is complete without that must-have photographic keepsake and Festival goers will be getting a touch of the impossible with theirs, learning the tricks of the magical trade, and Graze on a magical picnic. The College of Magic, a non-profit organisation and the only one of its kind in the world, celebrates 41 years of teaching the theatrical performing art of magic and its allied arts as well as vital life-skills to children and adults in 2021. The organisation is thrilled to have an opportunity to reinvent the Children’s Magic Festival experience for a new audience. Book Tickets at Quicket
