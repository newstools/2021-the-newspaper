South African musicians deserve the best possible service, whether sourcing music for teaching and performance, or purchasing an instrument such as a piano, string or wind instrument, guitar, ukulele, or recorder. Allmusic’s team of piano specialists provide professional advice and friendly assistance in tuning, transportation and restoration of pianos. “On sale in our showroom are fully refurbished pianos for very reasonable prices. Most pianos can be repaired, though ancient pianos, with hardly any antique value and extensive damage, are virtually impossible to repair. Honest advice by our trustworthy experts can prevent unnecessary costs, so, if uncertain, rather consult us first.” “Whether for beginners, performers or for exams, Allmusic offers unique personal advice and speedy service in supplying printed music for any instrument or style from our international distributors. This includes orchestral, ensemble and choir music of which we either have stock or can order, our motto being: whatever we cannot find, does not exist.”
A large variety of theory books ensures that music students understand all aspects of music theory and can prepare for written exams. “When clients visit our store, they can browse at will, the experience being that they are often amazed at the discovery of some wonderful gems! Orders can be finalized, and we can give an estimate cost and the approximate time it will take to supply the title.” Visit the Allmusic store in 36 Jeanette St, Brackenfell, contact 021 981 5551 or visit www.allmusic.co.za
