During the current public health crisis, we have grown perhaps a little too familiar with our own four walls. COVID-19 and lockdown has forced upon us a period of reflection, removing the possibility of travel in the interim due to safety concerns. A post lockdown yearning for open spaces along with the desire to avoid crowded spaces has shifted remote, empty destinations to the top of many travellers’ wish lists. Domestic leisure travellers now prefer staycations – a new travel trend, according to South African Tourism. What is a staycation? A staycation is a period in which an individual or family stays home and participates in leisure activities within day trip distance of their home and does not require overnight accommodation. It encourages the traveller to take time out, discover nearby landscapes, reconnect, and spend more time outdoors in nature with family and friends. Activities on a staycation include a scenic drive along the coastline, a visit to a local park, nature reserve, farmstall, frolicking in the snow, experience the beauty of the wild flowers and the canola fields in bloom, have a picnic on a wine farm, whale watching, and many more. Some staycationers also like to follow a set of rules, such as setting a start and end date, planning ahead, and avoiding routine, with the goal of creating the feel of a traditional vacation. Benefits of a staycation include the promotion of the local economy, and rediscovering the beauty of your city or region. Last but not least: A staycation allows you to learn how to take advantage of the present moment. The Western Cape will benefit from the increased demand for staycations in 2021. This region offers diverse beauty, so people seeking an escape from the boredom of lockdown, are spoiled for choice.
