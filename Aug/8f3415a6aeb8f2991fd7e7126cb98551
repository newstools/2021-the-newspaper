Event Organisers, Stillwater Sports are excited to welcome The Kindness Collaboration Project as the official charity of the 6th annual Fedhealth MTB Challenge that will take place at the Blaauwklippen Wine Estate (Stellenbosch) on Saturday, 11 and Sunday 12 September 2021. “We are proud to welcome The Kindness Collaboration Project as the official charity of the 2021 Fedhealth MTB Challenge. Founded by Fedhealth and Operation Healing Hands, The Kindness Collaboration Project offers its support to families that don’t have access to or can’t afford quality medical care. The Project is a wonderful initiative that raises funds to cover the cost of preventative and life-saving screenings and/or surgeries. The mountain biking community can show their support by making a donation while entering online for the 2021 Fedhealth MTB Challenge. No donation is too small and entrants that donate R400 or more will receive a rider jersey compliments of Operation Healing Hands and Fedhealth,” says Michael Meyer, Managing Director of Stillwater Sports and Founder of the event. Says Jeremy Yatt, Fedhealth Principal Officer: “After the extremely difficult 2020 experienced by us all, Fedhealth felt the need to put our name and backing behind a project that could achieve some good in 2021. So, we have partnered with Operation Healing Hands (OHH) to launch The Kindness Collaboration. This project will see us, working closely with OHH, our members and partners, raise the funds to change the lives of South Africans who cannot otherwise afford quality medical care.”
