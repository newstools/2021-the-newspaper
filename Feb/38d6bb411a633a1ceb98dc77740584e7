Celebrating its 11th anniversary in 2021, the AfricanX Trailrun is proud to continue supporting The Timothy James Harlow Foundation. A non-profit organisation, The Timothy James Harlow Foundation was founded by the Harlow family in order to continue the selfless giving legacy of their beloved son Timothy who passed away on the 27th of April 2013. “The AfricanX Trailrun has a long-standing relationship with The Timothy James Harlow Foundation. We are proud to continue supporting the exceptional work that they do. Runners can also show their support by making a donation towards this deserving cause. Donations can be made when entering the AfricanX Trailrun online,” says Michael Meyer, Founder and Managing Director of Stillwater Sports. “We are continuously searching for opportunities to make a difference in the lives of individuals and communities,” says Nicholas Harlow, Trustee / The Timothy James Harlow Foundation. “We’ve established a framework comprising of three categories to guide us in choosing candidates.” “These categories are: 1. Individuals and/or communities whose right to life is in jeopardy, 2. Education and 3. God-given talents.” “By being part of the AfricanX Trailrun we are able to create more awareness around communities that are in need, spread the message of hope, and inspire others to do the same,” continues Harlow. “This year we’d like to give runners the opportunity to get more involved by allowing them to identify the ‘candidate’ that they’d like us to support. It might be one charity, or it might be more than one charity. It all depends on the feedback that we receive. All donations received will go towards the selected charity. We’d like to thank runners in advance for their support. We can’t wait to be part of the 11th edition of the AfricanX Trailrun in March.”
