Stanford Valley Guest Farm nestles in the valley of the Klein River, 10km outside the quint village of Stanford, along the R326 to Napier, only two-hours’ drive from Cape Town and 34km from Hermanus. The guest farm is the perfect location for couples or families for a weekend get-away from the hustle and bustle of city life, a small wedding, a conference or a base to explore the beautiful surroundings. Two hundred-and-fifty of the 440ha farm are part of a Nature Conservancy and covered in a wide variety of fynbos, while the most attractive aspect of Stanford Valley Guest House is its serene country atmosphere. The guest farm offers comfortable accommodation in their charming, self-catering cottages and large en-suite rooms. The cottages are built around a central werf, giving it the feeling of a small village whilst allowing each guest unit the privacy of its own stoep and garden – surrounded by sweeping lawns, paddocks and incredible mountain views. The cottages and rooms are decorated in warm colours with an old-fashioned touch, and boast with a fireplace for utmost comfort during winter. Enjoy contemporary country cooking prepared by the talented Manor House kitchen team at this popular Overberg restaurant where meals are served against a backdrop of mid-century modern décor, eclectic art and breath-taking views of the Akkedisberg Mountains. There are many activities at the Stanford Valley Guest Farm that might interest you.
