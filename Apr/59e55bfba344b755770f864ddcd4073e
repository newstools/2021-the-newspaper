South Africa’s most prestigious wine event, the Cape Fine & Rare Wine Auction announced the line-up of outstanding wines that will be auctioned at the annual event on 22 May 2021. Following a year that has impacted the South African wine industry like no other, the auction will celebrate the outstanding skill and tenacious spirit of the country’s wine makers. The wines selected for the auction represent the rarest and finest South African wines available today, including bottles meticulously preserved since the 1960s, wines produced under South Africa’s pioneering Old Vine Project, and the highest quality wines from the country’s most successful vintages – 2009 and 2015. Some of the rarest wines that will go on sale include Chateau Libertas 1970, Kanonkop Paul Sauer 2009, Le Lude Rosé Agrafé 2012, Nederburg Private Bin Eminence 1999, Uva Mira O.T.V 2015, Vilafonté Series C 2005, and Zonnebloem Cabernet Sauvignon 1970. The wines selected for the auction have been painstakingly curated by highly-respected South African wine insiders. For the first time, collectors from all over the world will be able to attend and bid for wines, as the auction will be presented in a modern, hybrid virtual format. This will allow for live bidding online as well as in person, with in-room bidding taking place in Stellenbosch. Taking up the gavel once again will be lively Christie’s auctioneer Charlie Foley who has long championed the collectability of South African wine.
