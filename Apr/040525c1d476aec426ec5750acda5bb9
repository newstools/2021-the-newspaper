Le Pommier is located on Helshoogte Pass, the main route between Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. It is ideally situated to explore this unique and most breath-taking region of the Cape Winelands. Le Pommier meaning ‘The Apple Tree’ in French, was once an apple orchard; it was a part of the 300-year-old Zorgvliet farm before. Today you will still find a couple of these apple trees scattered on Le Pommier. The history of Le Pommier includes a lengthy list of owners since the 1600s. The restaurant was even an animal shed in 1916, used for storing animal feed. Current owners bought Le Pommier at the end of 2014. Various upgrades have been done, including the planting of additional Malbec & Cabernet Franc vineyards. Le Pommier is a working wine farm where all of the grapes used in the Le Pommier Wine range are grown. Le Pommier has five wines available, Sauvignon Blanc, Rosé, MAC Cabernet Franc and Malbec blend. Both Le Pommier Angle Peur Cabernet Franc and Jonathan’s Malbec are limited release wines. Wine tastings and wine pairings are available at the farm. Le Pommier offers a country styled restaurant, which is open seven days a week. The restaurant has a rustic, comfortable bistro type atmosphere and is child friendly. A venue perfect for parties, weddings, or conferences is also available. Packages can be tailor-made according to each individual’s needs. Le Pommier Lodge consists of six suites, seven country rooms and two self-catering units, with two pools on the farm. For more information visit www.lepommier.co.za or email gm@lepommier.co.za
