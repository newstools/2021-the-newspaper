Cape Town scored 16th – higher than locations such as New York, Athens, Barcelona – on the list of 75 cities. The index score was based on a range of factors including cost of living, infrastructure, leisure activities, and overall liveability. This once again proves that we are a top class, affordable destination for digital nomads and bolsters our call for a remote work visa – which was also a factor in Nestpick’s index. Digital nomads typically stay longer than 90 days in a destination. As such, I am making submissions to National Government to make provisions in the Immigration Act to allow for a Remote Working Visa for a period longer than three months. In fact, the City’s Enterprise and Investment team has already incorporated this position into our strategic marketing approach known as the Six Pillars: Visit, Live, Work, Study, Play and Invest in Cape Town. The City also recently hosted a Remote Work Webinar in which we heard from stakeholders at key tourism and hospitality organisations about how and why to appeal to digital nomads. The remote work model isn’t just a trend, it’s here to stay. Let’s fully capitalise on what we as a city can offer these 21st century workers. By encouraging more of them to choose Cape Town, we will be boosting the economy as they will spend more time and money in our city. They will also amplify the message among their friends, family, and networks about Cape Town being a prime destination for work and play.
