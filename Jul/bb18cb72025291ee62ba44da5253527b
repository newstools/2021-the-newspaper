Boarding at Somerset College is a fundamental part of our thriving campus and school spirit. This is where students experience an even deeper sense of presence and involvement, through the combination of mutual respect, camaraderie and tradition. Those who are part of the collective “Helderberg” boarding houses are proud to call Somerset College “home”. There are two Boarding Houses at Somerset College, Founders House for girls and Vineyard House for boys, collectively known as Helderberg. Grade 8 to 12 students are eligible for boarding at Somerset College. The Heads of Boarding are assisted by Boarding House Assistants who help to manage the day-to-day running of the Houses.  “We strive to continue offering a home away from home for our approximately 120 boarders, giving them an experience that fosters aspiration through the development of character, pride and a love for life. This experience becomes an indelible part of the life story of every student.” Close emotional support ensures that students are not only introduced to the School and Boarding House procedures and operations, but are personally guided through them. Students will become a part of the various support structures that are in place to help them comfortably adjust to campus life rather than feel overwhelmed by it. When boarding at Somerset College, students can take full advantage of everything that the boarding experience has to offer, creating a working, learning and living experience at Somerset College that will be memorable and lifelong.
