How many of the same MTB trails can a mountain biker cycle before s/he gets bored? The answer my friend ain’t blowing in the wind. It’s probably the main reason many riders over the years have asked: “Why don’t you do W2W in reverse?” and the response was, “We can’t, as the route can’t simply be cycled in reverse.” But then after cycling the route for eleven years, we also thought: “Let’s look at how we can develop a new route, especially on Stages 1 and 3. We also thought that Cape Trails have an extraordinary set of trail development skills and we’ve established a huge network of trails, which can easily be applied to ensure that we create the same ‘FNB W2W Fun-on-a-bike’ experience.” Main route changes Stage 1: Rotary View Drive in Hermanus is back, as the major climb from the start at Curro School; A new contour section in Karwyderskraal; Climbing up Katpass, a long and gradual climb; and New trail sections in Houwhoek area towards Paul Cluver and Oak Valley. Main route changes Stage 2: New start section in Oak Valley, and New Rietvlei Magic section (and another monumental MTB structure which will be completed by July) in Paul Cluver. Main route changes Stage 3: New trails and climbs in Grabouw forest towards Gantouw; First time down Gantouw Pass; New trails in Idiom and via Vergelegen towards Lourensford; and Lourensford section, is 80% new, including a 5km gradual climb, followed by a 7km downhill towards the finish, with amazing and flowing new single tracks.
“The FNB W2W Switchback gives us the opportunity to rotate the route on an annual basis. We pride ourselves to not only continuously improve and be the best, but also to lead by example in the creativity space.” “Enter now and join us on a new, but similar and best MTB experience, the FNB W2W Switchback, in 2021,” – Johan Kriegler, Founder Wines2Whales.
