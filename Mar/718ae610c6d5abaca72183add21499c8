FAB, the Western Cape’s longest standing, most renowned, most reliable and glamorous bridal show, is happening every year at the beautiful and upmarket Venue D’Aria in Durbanville. FAB Bridal Expo offer those who are planning their wedding (or even a special or corporate event, or birthday party) access to every-thing they need for their special day. FAB brings together service providers and products from across the Cape all under one roof and puts visitors in touch with the various experts they need in order to plan their wedding or host a successful event. Attending the expo ultimately saves money, time and possible frustration as visitors will be able to gather advice and inspiration to cover almost every aspect of their planning.
Where else can you pick a venue, book your honeymoon, meet a dress designer and discuss designs for your event stationery all in one location? Even those in need of a special garment or unique piece of jewellery will benefit. Highly experienced and creative experts in their different fields will be available over the two-day period to answer questions, assist with queries, or to be of general assistance to visitors. Not only will visitors be able to see a wide selection of static displays of stunning gowns by most of Cape Town’s well known and up-and-coming designers, but FAB-goers will also get the opportunity to see and experience different designs on the ramp during the three daily fashion shows from 13 – 14 March 2021.
