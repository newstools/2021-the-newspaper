The Galileo is synonymous with summertime happiness in the Mother City, bringing movie magic to majestic venues, paired with delicious food and impeccable views. Due to Covid and government regulations, their beloved Picnic screenings have been suspended until further notice, but fear not, The Galileo has safe and fun alternatives for you to still enjoy a unique movie experience. The Galileo Royale is the brand-new spin-off to the popular Galileo screenings and takes place every Wednesday until the end of April. Lap up luxury and the royal treatment with a one-hour live music performance, movie under the stars, backrest, blanket, welcome drink, appetiser and popcorn – all included in your ticket price. This intimate affair will only cater for a limited number of movie-goers so pre-booking is essential. The spectacular string of venues includes The Cellars-Hohenort Hotel, Suikerbossie, Casa Labia and Radisson Blu Hotel Waterfront. If you were a fan of their Picnic screenings then this will certainly be your new go-to. The Galileo Drive In continues each week from Friday to Sunday with a range of blockbuster hits and family favourites. Park backwards and cuddle up with your loved ones and pillows and blankets in the boot. Pre-order a selection of goodies with your tickets or bring along your favourite snacks for a nostalgic night out. This retro movie experience takes place across the southern & northern suburbs and will be available throughout winter as well. For more information visit www.thegalileo.co.za
