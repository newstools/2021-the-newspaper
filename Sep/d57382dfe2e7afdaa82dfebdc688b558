Fly a kite at the first-ever Hybrid Cape Town International Kite Festival from 2 – 31 October and help show the world that #EveryoneDeservesToFly is in support of Cape Mental Health. Enjoy a mix of real-life and online activities with an incredible competition, kite-making workshops, interviews with kiters around the world, and pop-up open-air kite-flying.
Cape Mental Health’s annual flagship event is going hybrid for its 27th edition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to raise over R100 000,00 to enable this hard-working non-profit organisation to continue providing essential free mental healthcare services and ensuring that everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, can enjoy equality in mental health access and care in an unequal world. According to Dr Ingrid Daniels, CEO of Cape Mental Health and President of the World Federation for Mental Health, “Mental health is regarded as the third highest burden of disease in South Africa, but remains the most neglected aspect of health care, competing with other medical conditions including the health costs of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine roll-out.” “Naturally, this underinvestment in mental health has a significant impact on access to mental health in poor and under-resourced communities and rural areas. We call for equality in mental health care – our people deserve nothing less.” Not keen on flying a kite or participating online? Make a donation as all proceeds go to Cape Mental Health to help provide essential free mental healthcare services and continue our remote tele-counselling and mental health interventions across the Western Cape.
