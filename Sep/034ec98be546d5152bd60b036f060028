THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN ambassadors, Nicholas Rupanga (Kenilworth, Cape Town), Franza Landman (East London), Ashraf Orrie (Plumstead, Cape Town), and Blake Dyason (Hout Bay, Cape Town) are counting down the days to the inaugural THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN 1-Day XPERIENCE that will take place at the much-loved Paul Cluver Wines, Grabouw on Saturday, 18 September 2021. South Africa’s premier three-day stage trail run, the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN was founded in 2009 and is synonymous with magnificent trails, spectacular views, mouth-watering food, a relaxed atmosphere, and a great vibe. Having only missed one event, in 2014 due to injury, trail legend Nicholas Rupanga has crossed the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN finish line 10 out of the 11 times.
Rupanga finished first in the inaugural event in 2009 with team member Patrick Cox. According to Rupanga the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN is unique. “The list of things that attracts me to the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN is endless,” says Franza Landman. “From the welcoming and well organised registration to the fabulous vibe, efficient, helpful and friendly staff – it’s just a well organised event.” “I don’t want to miss any of the AFRICANX events, the FOMO will be unbearable. I guarantee that once newcomers to the sport have experienced the AFRICANX vibe at the 1-Day event they will want more.” For Ashraf Orrie aka Mr O, it’s the pristine trails that attract him to the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN. “Expanding AFRICANX into a national series of events is a great initiative,” says Orrie. “We are spoilt in the Western Cape, so it’s great to share the love with the North-West Province, Gauteng, and KwaZulu-Natal. I am really chuffed that the 1-Day event will take place in the same region as the 3-Day event. We will still make a weekend of it. I’m looking forward to running some beautiful trails, receiving a great medal and event t-shirt and of course enjoying the really good food.” The THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN 3-Day Stage Race was Blake Dyason’s first multi-day trail run. “AFRICANX will always be special to me,” says Dyason. “I love the team and vibe at this event. I look forward to seeing new places and making new friends. I love Paul Cluver, I am fortunate enough to have run and cycled on the farm before. It’s really a beautiful farm. We are definitely in for a treat at the THIRSTI AFRICANX TRAILRUN 1-Day XPERIENCE in September.”
