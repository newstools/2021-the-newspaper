The doom and gloom of the past year did not prevent Prins & Prins Diamonds from providing a sparkling service and beautiful diamonds to engagement couples and lovers of fine jewellery. This family business owns the historic Huguenot House (ca1752) in the heart of the Mother City, from where a complete diamond, gemstone and jewellery service is offered. When you visit Prins and Prins, experts will explain how to judge a diamond’s quality, price, and integrity while jewellery designers create unique items for each client. Consulting rooms are private, and you can browse through large showrooms without obligation. Their in-house goldsmiths have been finalists and winners at the Platafrica Jewellery Competition since 1995, true specialists in the craft of handmade jewellery. If you need a repair or alteration, you can trust them with your precious jewellery. Their gemmologists can identify, grade, and value gems and jewellery and determine if a diamond is natural or made by man. They also purchase unwanted gold and diamonds. In the cellar of Huguenot House, you will find the Museum of Gems & Jewellery. Thirty-two showcases explain the origin of diamonds, gold and platinum, how jewellery styles developed since pre-history, the cultural significance of Mapungubwe, Blombos Cave, the meaning of African bead jewellery, and much more. You can even see how diamonds are cut and polished. Indeed, a worthwhile visit at no charge. The Prins and Prins diamond experience are unique to Cape Town, if not the world.
