During this extended period of limited travel, Hermanus FynArts brings the arts of the world home to you from 10 – 20 June 2021. Engage with the arts and culture of Russia (10/11), Japan (12/13), India (14/15) and, of course, South Africa (16 – 20) through a full programme that includes, apart from the two FynArts stalwarts, the Strauss&Co Series of talks and presentations and Bouchard Finlayson art award and exhibition, top class performances, workshops, demonstrations, book readings, films, food and drink – and armchair travel. All Covid19 regulations applicable at the time. “We will therefore have waiting lists for all events that are sold out in case we can be allowed to increase audience sizes at the last minute or insert a repeat of the relevant event.” For more information visit www.hermanusfynarts.co.za
