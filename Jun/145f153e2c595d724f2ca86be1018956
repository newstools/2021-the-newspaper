In these turbulent times we find ourselves in why not treat yourself to an all-inclusive winelands getaway, where your weekend has been meticulously planned for you from check in to check out. Franschhoek’s popular Mystery Weekends hold the promise of surprise, relaxation and pure indulgence. Your all-encompassing weekend includes all that Franschhoek is known for – from luxurious accommodation, award-winning wines, gourmet cuisine and bespoke experiences. Since its inception in 2012 the Mystery Weekends have welcomed more than 2 000 visitors to the region, reaffirming Franschhoek as one of SA’s premier travel destinations. The Franschhoek Mystery Weekends are ideally suited to couples, seeking time out from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The allure of the weekend is that you don’t need to book a single thing as it is all taken care of for you. Your experience starts with an exclusive (and unconventional) check in event planned for all guests. Mingle over a glass of wine before opening your special Mystery Weekend box, which contains all of the exciting details as to where you’ll be staying, where you’ll be dining and what you’ll be experiencing, including a fun and informal evening where you are welcomed to the valley in true Franschhoek fashion. Although most of your weekend is pre-planned there is ample time to enjoy a leisurely stroll through the village to browse the local market, art galleries, artisanal chocolate shops and bespoke boutique ateliers you’re bound to discover. The confirmed dates for this year’s Franschhoek Mystery Weekends are 25 – 27 June; 30 July – 1 August; with the final weekend set for 27 – 29 August.
