Cape Town has a brand-new hotel, and it is something special – like nothing else in South Africa and only one of three in the World. The 28-floor Metlife Centre – formerly an office block, and one of the tallest buildings on the foreshore, has been converted into a residential building known as Hotel Sky. It gets better. The hotel has a 30-metres tall roller coaster ride on the rooftop which towers above the Cape Town City bowl. The “lift chair” will take you to the sky giving you a bird’s eye view of one of the most beautiful cities in the World. If the idea of an exhilarating, gravity-defying, breath taking drop reaching speeds of 75km/hr and 3G’s excites you – then this adventure is for you! The weather-permitting Sky-Hi Ride is limited to 10 riders per ride and is open daily between 09h00 and 21h00, to both hotel guests and outside visitors. The spacious deck below the ride also offers sweeping views of the city, making it an ideal venue for celebrations, birthday parties, corporate functions and private events to continue your Hotel Sky Cape Town experience. Hotel Sky, has two in-house concierges. Skyla and Ariel are stellar employees, because they never take time off as these two are Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered robots. Skyla and Ariel are in charge of room service delivery, luggage carriage and answering general questions, among other things. The hotel guarantees that guests will have a great stay “whether dining in one of their decadent restaurants, enjoying a sundowner in one of the cocktail bars, chatting to one of our A.I. enabled robots, or listening to the automated Grand Piano play a song.
