No longer a pipe dream, Franschhoek’s restaurant recovery initiative will officially launch on 15 November, and what better way than with the ‘I Love My Hoek’ campaign. Take your love for Franschhoek one step further by earning as you spend. Simply spend R400 or more at one of the participating businesses using the SnapScan app. In return, you’ll receive Hoekcoin to the value of R200, which will be saved in your SnapScan Wallet.
Support Franschhoek and this amazing initiative by spending your Hoekcoin at any of the other participating businesses before the campaign ends. I Love My Hoek campaign forms part of the Franschhoek Restaurant Appeal, which aims to raise enough money to help those affected establishments in the region, who have felt the biggest impact of the recent restrictions and more so the COVID-19 pandemic. Hoekcoin is simply a rewards programme to help boost local tourism within the Franschhoek Valley With a list of over 30 participating businesses, visitors will be spoilt for choice. These include La Petite Colombe, Reubens, Protégé, Maison at Chefs Warehouse, Arkeste, Le Bon Vivant, French Connection, Oku & Yama, Boschendal Bistro and Terra del Capo Antipasto Bar, among others.
