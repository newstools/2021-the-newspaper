Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden presents: Seeing the Invisible – an augmented reality (AR) art exhibition. The exhibition opens as one of 12 participating gardens across six countries. The ground-breaking exhibition allows Kirstenbosch visitors to observe 13 contemporary artworks from internationally acclaimed artists using a technology-mediated experience. The Seeing the Invisible app will use physical locations in Kirstenbosch and augment the real world with virtual artworks. The exhibition will be featured simultaneously in 12 other biomes all around the world. Each artwork explores the boundaries and connections between art, technology and nature, some with thought-provoking perspectives. Seeing the Invisible was developed as a collaboration of botanical gardens around the world. It was initiated by the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens and Outset Contemporary Art Fund, with the support of The Jerusalem Foundation. Visitors will be able to access the 13 Seeing the Invisible artworks at Kirstenbosch via a smartphone or tablet through the Seeing of the Invisible app. The app is available for free to download from the Google Play or App Store.
