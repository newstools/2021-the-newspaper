Table Bay Mall, situated on Cape Town’s Western Seaboard, has announced a host of new tenants that will join their retail portfolio in the lead up to Christmas. This growth in new retail stores and brands has been enhanced by the shopping mall’s commitment to supporting small businesses and ensuring their on-going success. Over the last two years, they have created retail spaces dedicated to showcasing small business brands, such as The Creative Cube, The Food Cube, the Table Bay Mall Market, the annual Festive Market and the soon to open, Fashion Cube. To date, they have been able to successfully house 130 small locally-made small businesses. According to Rian Thompson, Centre Manager at Table Bay Mall they wanted to step out of the normal retail box and open retail space to these amazing small businesses. This year alone, the mall has welcomes eight new tenants, with an additional eight new stores opening in the coming months, adding more than 2,730m2 of retail space to its 2020 offering. Table Bay Mall has continued to show positive growth compared to other shopping centres. A unique Table Bay Mall initiative, The Fashion Cube, is set to open in November. This newly-built and designed 360m² retail space will consist of 32 retail units where small business fashions brands display their product ranges in a custom-designed retail space. Despite the economic strain experienced by the retail industry over the past 18 months, shopping malls have reported a recovery in footfall and retail sales. In fact, lockdowns have favoured community and regional malls such as Table Bay Mall that give consumers a quick in-and-out shopping experience.
