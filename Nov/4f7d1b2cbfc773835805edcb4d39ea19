MSC Cruises will resume its South African sailings on 6 December 2021 following approvals in the most recent government gazette. MSC Orchestra, a popular ship for South African holidaymakers, will homeport in Durban and Cape Town for the local 2021/22 season and offer 2, 3, 4 and 7-night voyages up to 11 May 2022. The vessel has recently undergone a major refurbishment programme and replaces the MSC Musica that was originally earmarked for South Africa in the upcoming cruise season. MSC Orchestra will welcome guests on a total of 41 local cruises from both Durban – with embarkation at the soon-to-be inaugurated KwaZulu Natal terminal – and Cape Town, providing South African cruisers with a wide choice of options to suit their holiday needs. Highlights include Pomene Bay in Mozambique – a marine safari experience complete with its beach club, Portuguese Island and other destinations in Southern Africa. “We are now eagerly awaiting the relevant authorities in South Africa to issue specifics of their health and safety guidelines which can be built into its protocol, as required.” “We are delighted to have received confirmation and approval from the government that cruising and with it our local season can proceed. I believe that our return to sailing will provide a welcome boost to the South African economy in terms of direct and indirect employment, as well as offering safe and relaxing cruise holidays,” said Ross Volk, Managing Director, MSC Cruises South Africa.” The planned 14-night New Year’s Eve cruise during the coming season has also been altered into three 4-night cruises and one 2-night sailing as a result of a lack of available ports in the original itinerary.
