Did you know that the Table Mountain Cableway officially opened to the public on October 4, 1929? Travellers initially took a trip up Table Mountain in a wooden cable car with a tin roof. It took the cable car nearly ten minutes back then to carry 19 people and a conductor up the 704 metres to the summit. Since its inception, the cableway has transported over 29 million visitors. A lot has changed over the decades, but the cableway remains one of Cape Town’s biggest tourist attractions. October has been a special month for the Mother City’s icon as the cableway celebrated 92 years of being operational. The beloved activity has offered local and international guests some of the most incredible experiences over the past 92 years. The cable car carries up to 65-passengers and has a rotating floor that ensures visitors get a 360-degree aerial view. The cherry on top is that Table Mountain has been named Africa’s leading tourist attraction by the 2021 World Travel Awards (WTA)! This is not the first time the icon has snatched the top prize, as it has held this position since 2019. Cape Town’s favourite attraction went up against the likes of Mountain Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, and even home favourites, Robben Island and the V&A Waterfront. Table Mountain is also in the running to be voted as the World’s Leading Tourist Attraction.
