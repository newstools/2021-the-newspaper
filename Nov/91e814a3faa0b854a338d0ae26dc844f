Gaven Sinclair, SA’s top extreme endurance adventurer, life coach, motivational speaker and Recipient of the Purple Hearts SA Award, is no stranger to the challenges of living with a lifestyle condition. Gavin has been running the Heel2Heal Challenge along the coastline of South Africa from Gqeberha to Cape Town to raise awareness for health and wellness. His goal is to complete the run by the first week of November and inspire those living with chronic conditions to take up the challenge and start with one small step each day. He partnered with Syntro-P Wellbeing to share a story of partnership and hope with the Heel2Heal Challenge. Recent research states that South Africa is one of the unhealthiest countries in the world, and more than 60% of the adult population is living with a chronic condition. It is this entropy that prompted cto bring together a team of leading South African experts to create a revolutionary, virtual prescribed health and wellbeing programme – a first of its kind for people diagnosed with chronic conditions which include diabetes, eating disorders, heart disease, obesity, asthma, hypertension and many more. By providing dietary guidelines, exercise and movement routines, breathing techniques, life skills, home monitoring solutions and educational insights, Syntro-P Wellbeing believes that by helping South Africans change their behaviour, they can help change society as a whole. Gaven Sinclair rose to fame in 2017 when he cycled for more than 10 000 km from the Cape to Cairo. Today, Gaven is unarguably recognised as South Africa’s top solo, unsupported, extreme endurance adventurer having completed a 4000 km run across 4 African countries in 2018; a 5 km swim from Ilha de Mozambique to Coral Lodge in 2019; and a 388 km run along the coast of Mozambique in 2020. Additionally, Gaven is the founder of Get Lost in Africa; and has secured his reputation as a leading motivational speaker, life coach and humanitarian activist.
