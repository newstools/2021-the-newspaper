As global travel catches a glimmer of hope, dormant flight paths are reawakening, with embattled airlines rearing to capitalise on a post-lockdown passenger boom. In October Air France resumed the Paris/Cape Town flights, Edelweiss resumed the Zurich/Cape Town route, while Lufthansa added additional frequencies on the Frankfurt route and the Munich flights resumed. Most African carriers have already resumed operations to Cape Town. We look forward to welcoming visitors from the UK back to the Western Cape, with the first British Airways flight between London Heathrow and Cape Town International Airport scheduled to resume from 1 November 2021. The airline said it would also restart services to Cape Town, offering three flights a week in November, before moving to a double daily service in December. Etihad announced that it would start flying to Johannesburg and Cape Town on 25 November. These South African routes will be serviced three times a week, with flights on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, with 28 Business Studios, 78 Economy Space seats and 184 Economy seats, will operate between Abu Dhabi and South Africa. The United Airlines New York (Newark) to Cape Town will resume their operation to Cape Town from 1 December 2021 with 3 flights per week, while Virgin Atlantic has announced the relaunch of its direct flight service from London Heathrow to Cape Town three times a week from 17 December. KLM, Turkish Airlines, Emirates, and Qatar will continue to operate their year-round schedules.
