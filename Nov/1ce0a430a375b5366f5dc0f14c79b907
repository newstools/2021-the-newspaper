To get to know the West Coast with a road trip – you have to taste a culture to understand it. The West Coast culture is about giving as much as you can and more – and it is no different when it comes to the food. The West Coast Way Foodie Route showcases the relationship between passion, innovation, and food. Storytelling and earthy hospitality is part and parcel of the West Coast. As the Foodie Route is a self-drive circular route – as a day trip, short break from Cape Town or extended West Coast holiday – it is up to you whether you want to linger longer. The Foodie Route, which was developed by West Coast Way, includes some of the most beautiful and interesting outlying towns and locations on the Cape West Coast such as Langebaan, Saldanha Bay, Jacobsbaai, Paternoster, Cape Columbine, St Helena Bay, Shelley Point, Velddrif, and Hopefield. When experiencing the Foodie Route, you have to chew on a bokkom (whole, salted and dried mullet) when visiting Bokkomlaan in Velddrif, eat fresh fish, mussels, oysters, prawns, crayfish, or a seafood platter at one of the many acclaimed restaurants. The Foodie Route showcases attractions including the West Coast National Park, West Coast Fossil Park, Saldanha Bay Cultural Village and Museum, and the Simply Bee Observation Centre in Hopefield. Activities on the Foodie Route: Enjoy wine, craft beer, olives and Rooibos tea tastings, lagoon or river cruises, sand-boarding, quad-biking, kayaking, beach hopping, birdwatching, hiking, mountain biking, trail running, or learn more about the fishing history and listen to some local stories to become acquainted with the culture of the West Coast.
